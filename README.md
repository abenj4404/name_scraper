# name_scraper


(1) PURPOSE:  The purpose of this file is to scrape data from specified URLs in order to save that data to a CSV file. Beyond that, I will be using the
data to populate a database I've designed with PostgreSQL. Specifically, this file scrapes data from a website called Behind the Name by looping through
several pages of names, descriptions, and other associated data from within the Mythology category. 

(2) TECHNOLOGIES USED:  Requests, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, NumPy

(3) DEPENDENCIES: see requirements.txt in this repository.


Let me know if you have questions, suggestions or comments. Thanks!
